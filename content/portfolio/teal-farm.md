   L.N. Consulting completed the mechanical and electrical design for the Living Future Project located in Huntington Vermont.  The project is incorporating geothermal heating, solar hot water heating, 9kW hydroelectric power generation, 15 kW of solar power generation, cord wood heating boilers, and 6kW of wind turbine power generation for a group of buildings associated with a sustainable living farm.  The existing historic farm house was renovated and a new "energy" barn was constructed to support the multiple renewable energy systems.
