   L.N. Consulting was retained to complete the HVAC design for a geothermal HVAC system.  We were also retained to complete the residence plumbing design.  The residence has approximately 8500 s.f. of living space.  The geothermal system is based upon a standing column well linked to multiple water to air heat pumps for living spaces and a water to water heat pump for radiant heat and domestic water heating.  This home has a gas fired boiler for pool heating and back-up residence heat.  Our design included the bathroom ventilation, energy recovery ventilation for the living spaces, the kitchen ventilation system, and a ventilation system for multiple fireplaces.  The project was completed in the spring of 2009.
