   L.N. Consulting was retained to complete the HVAC design for a geothermal HVAC system.  The residence has approximately 5000 s.f. of living space and music studio space.  The geothermal system is based upon a standing column well linked to multiple water to air heat pumps for living spaces and a water to water heat pump for radiant heat and domestic water heating.  The design includes a solar domestic water heating system as well.  Our design included the bathroom ventilation, and energy recovery ventilation for the living spaces and music studio.  The project was completed in 2008.
