				<h3>University of Vermont ? Marsh Life Science Expansion</h3>
				<p>
   
   L.N. Consulting completed the design and construction administration for the UVM Marsh Life Science Expansion Project.  This is a UVM nutritional science laboratory and education facility.  We worked with John Anderson Studios on the project.  The building is approximately 17,000 square feet.  This project included a ventilation system fitted with an efficient heat recovery system and variable air volume distribution system.  The building was designed with a balance of natural light using specialized glazing systems and skylights.  The building design included a creative implementation of a heat recovery system for the existing building so that new central plant cooling and heating equipment would not be required.  Our creative approach to this project saved UVM operating energy for the existing building and construction capital because they did not need to purchase additional plant equipment.  The estimated cost of mechanical and electrical construction is $2.1 million.  The construction was completed January 2006.  The project has received LEED Silver certification.
