				<h3>Maxwell Farm ?Cow Power? Cogeneration Project</h3>
				<p>
   
   L.N. Consulting assisted Vermont Electric Cooperative (VEC) to connect the farm?s 225 kW methane generator to the overhead utility circuits.  The project involved investigating the protective device settings of the generator, making recommended changes, and providing overhead protective device (?reclosers?) relay settings.  L.N. Consulting also programmed and tested the reclosers and was present when the generator was first tied to the utility?s electrical distribution system.
