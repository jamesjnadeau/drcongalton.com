				<h3>Rutland Regional Medical Center Emergency Department & Power Plant Project</h3>
				<p>
   
   L.N. Consulting, Inc. worked with Freeman French Freeman, Inc. in developing a new remote power plant facility, emergency department expansion, and diagnostic imaging renovation for Rutland Regional Medical Center.  The total construction cost was approximately $15 million.  The remote power plant included: a new steam heating plant, chilled water cooling plant, electrical substation, and emergency generation plant.  The basis of the plant design was reliability and energy efficiency.  The plant project received many incentives from Efficiency Vermont for efficient design techniques.  The emergency department project included: a 25,000 square foot expansion and 20,000 square foot renovation.  The new addition was fitted with new mechanical and electrical infrastructure that also received many incentives from Efficiency Vermont for efficient design techniques.  The project was completed within an aggressive but achievable schedule and also within the State of Vermont certificate of need budget requirements.
