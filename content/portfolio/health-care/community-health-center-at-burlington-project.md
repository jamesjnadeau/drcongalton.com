   L.N. Consulting is in the construction adminstration process for development of a new medical office facility including a dental office for the Community Health Center at Burlington.  The project includes the development of a water source heat pump system with a high efficiency heating system.  The building is designed with an energy recovery ventilation system fitted with a heat pump post conditioning system to maximize building performance.  The ventilation system is variable volume and utilizes ventilation demand controls.    The electrical design includes high efficiency lighting with occupancy based controls for minimal energy usage.  The building is projected to receive LEED Silver.
