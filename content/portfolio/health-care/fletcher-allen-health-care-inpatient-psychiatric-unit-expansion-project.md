   L.N. Consulting, Inc. worked with Tsio/Kobus & Associates and Freeman French Freeman in designing the expansion of the existing inpatient psychiatric unit at Fletcher Allen Health Care.  The expansion project included approximately 15,000 sq. ft. of new construction and 25,000 sq. ft. of renovations and included the construction of a (5) story structure adjacent and integrated to an existing hospital building.  The project included close coordination for mechanical and electrical infrastructure upgrades and redevelopment as well as technology integration for the unit security requirements.
