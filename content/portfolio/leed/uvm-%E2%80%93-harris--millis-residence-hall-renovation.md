				<h3>UVM ? Harris / Millis Residence Hall Renovation</h3>
				<p>
   
   L.N. Consulting completed design and construction administration services for the University of Vermont?s Harris-Millis Residence Hall Renovation Project. The Harris-Millis Residence Hall includes approximately 304 dormitory rooms of single, double, and triple occupancy.  The renovation consisted modifications to the roof drains, restroom plumbing fixtures and supporting plumbing, new electrical outlets and switches, new elevators, ADA upgrades, and the installation of a carbon monoxide detection system with upgrades to the existing fire alarm system.  The HVAC systems serving the bathrooms included multiple heat recovery ventilation units to maximize energy efficiency.  The project is registered for LEED Silver certification.
