				<h3>Middlebury College Franklin Environmental Center at Hillcrest Hall</h3>
				<p>
   
   L.N. Consulting completed the design and construction administration of the renovation of the Middlebury College Franklin Environmental Center.  The existing historic structure was renovated while a tasteful expansion was added to the South end of the building.  The project consisted of 11,000 total sq.ft.  This project includes high efficiency energy recovery ventilation, high efficiency lighting, 8.5 kW solar array for power production, and a hybrid standing column/water source well geothermal heat pump air conditioning system.  The building is utilizing less than 50% of the energy of an ASHRAE certified building due to the detail associated with the envelope physics, HVAC system design, and lighting design.  This project has been awarded LEED Platinum certification and was awarded the Better Building by Design Award in 2009.  The project was completed using a construction management contract.
