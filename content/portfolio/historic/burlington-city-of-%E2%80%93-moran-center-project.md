				<h3>Moran Center Project</h3>
				<p>
   
   L.N. Consulting is the design process for redevelopment of an existing waterfront power plant to a multi-tenanted retail program.  The project includes the development of a lake water cooled water source heat pump system with a high efficiency condensing boiler heating system.  The building is designed with an energy recovery ventilation system fitted with a heat pump post conditioning system to maximize building performance.  The ventilation system is variable volume and utilizes ventilation demand controls.  The electrical design includes high efficiency lighting with occupancy based controls for minimal energy usage.  The project is intending to obtain LEED Gold.
