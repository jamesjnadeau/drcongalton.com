				<h3>UVM Cook Hall Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Laboratory Project</h3>
				<p>
   
   L.N. Consulting completed the mechanical and electrical design for the University of Vermont Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Laboratory.  This project included environmental tolerance requirements for space humidity and temperature.  The duct work material selection and configuration was based upon proximity to electromagnetic fields generated by the lab equipment.  We utilized a water cooled computer room air conditioning system.  The fit-up was completed inside of an existing structure.  The design schedule was three months.
