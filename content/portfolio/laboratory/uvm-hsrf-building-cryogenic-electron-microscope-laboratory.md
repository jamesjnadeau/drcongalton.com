				<h3>UVM HSRF Building Cryogenic Electron Microscope Laboratory</h3>
				<p>
   
   L.N. Consulting, Inc. worked directly with the University of Vermont in developing an electron microscopy suite.  This is a structural biology lab located within the Health Science Research Facility, which utilizes new age electron microscopy and is fitted with its own film developer lab.  We had the opportunity to meet with the user group at the Wadsworth Center in Albany, N.Y. to understand labs of similar use and develop creative ideas to improve upon current design techniques.  The lab suite provides space for two (2) electron microscope rooms, one (1) preparation lab, and one (1) photo process room.  The end result was a tremendous success.  This lab is quieter and more environmentally stable than any lab the users have worked in and the users have over 40 years of collective experience in electron microscope laboratories.  The user involvement throughout the entire design process proved to be an invaluable asset.  The laboratory project included approximately 4,000 square feet.
