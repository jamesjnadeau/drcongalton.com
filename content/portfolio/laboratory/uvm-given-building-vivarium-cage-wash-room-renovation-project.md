				<h3>UVM Given Building Vivarium Cage-wash Room Renovation Project</h3>
				<p>
   
   L.N. Consulting, Inc worked directly with the University of Vermont in redeveloping a room that houses a new tunnel cage washer and an existing rack washer.  The cage-wash room is where the cages and appurtenances for the vivarium are sanitized.  The room design required AALAC (American Association for the Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care) compliance in addition to standard building codes.  The new tunnel washer required multiple infrastructure and utility renovations.  The new washroom is constructed to provide ease of sanitation and high durability for long-term operation.
