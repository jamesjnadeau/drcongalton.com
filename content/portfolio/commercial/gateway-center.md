   L.N. Consulting completed the design for the Mascoma laboratory building located in Lebanon, N.H.  The project encompasses 33,000 sq. ft. and is 3 levels of a 5 story building.  The laboratory needed to support microbiology and an R&D fermentation production suite.  The project has been designed with high efficiency systems using sustainable materials.  The waste destruct system was also designed around an energy efficient technique which utilizes chemical destruction in lieu of thermal destruction to reduce energy usage and operating costs.  The ventilation system is based around a high efficiency heat recovery ventilator with demand control ventilation for non-lab spaces.  The estimated cost of mechanical and electrical construction is $3,000,000.00.
