   L.N. Consulting completed the design for the renovation to the UVM Colchester Research Facility.  The research facility is comprised of multiuse laboratory spaces and support offices.  The renovation included an in depth analysis of the existing infrastructure to determine what existing system components could be reused to reduce operating costs while maintaining efficient building operation.  The renovation was approximately 30,000 square feet. The project was completed in 2008 and has received LEED Silver certification.
