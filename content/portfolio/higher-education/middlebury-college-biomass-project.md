				<h3>Middlebury College Biomass Project</h3>
				<p>
   
   L.N. Consulting completed the design and construction administration of the new 800 boiler horsepower wood chip heating plant for Middlebury College.  This plant was designed and connected to the existing cogeneration plant.  The Middlebury College cogeneration plant has a capacity of 1500 kW.  The new biomass plant will reduce the energy costs to Middlebury College by approximately $750,000.00 to $1,000,000.00 per year.  We worked closely with Middlebury College to develop the project from conceptual design through construction.  The project was completed using a construction management contract.
