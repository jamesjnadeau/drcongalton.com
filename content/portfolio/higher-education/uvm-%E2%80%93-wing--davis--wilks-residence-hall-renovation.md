				<h3>UVM Wing / Davis / Wilks Residence Hall Renovation</h3>
				<p>
   
   L.N. Consulting completed design and construction administration services for the University of Vermont's Wing-Davis-Wilks (WDW) Residence Hall Renovation Project. The WDW Residence Hall is approximately 127,000 sq. ft. and included approximately 250 dormitory rooms of single, double, and triple occupancy.  The project consisted of a complete renovation of the mechanical and electrical systems supporting the dormitory rooms and common areas within the building as well as developing a new student center infill between the dormitory wings.  The building fire alarm system and carbon monoxide detection system was upgraded to meet building code requirements.  The HVAC systems serving the bathrooms included multiple heat recovery ventilation units to maximize energy efficiency.  The project has achieved LEED Silver certification.
