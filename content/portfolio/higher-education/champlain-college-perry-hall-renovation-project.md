				<h3>Champlain College Perry Hall Renovation Project</h3>
				<p>
   
   L.N. Consulting completed the design for the Champlain College Perry Hall Renovation and Expansion Project.  This project consists of the historical renovation and expansion of an existing residence (originally constructed in 1859) to accommodate the admissions and student support services of the college.  The building is approximately 30,000 sq. ft.  The project HVAC systems include a geothermal heat pump system using (2) bore holes coupled to water source heat pumps via a plate and frame heat exchanger.  The building systems are independent of fossil fuels during normal operation.  The project also includes a demand controlled ventilation system using an energy recovery ventilator.  The building lighting is being designed to 0.3 watts/sq.ft. power density, and incorporates complete occupancy sensor controls and day lighting controls for spaces with exterior windows.  The building is expected to utilize less than 30% of the energy of an ASHRAE 90.1 compliant building due to the detail associated with the envelope physics, geothermal HVAC system design, and lighting design.  The project is currently projected to achieve a LEED NC 2009 Platinum Certification.
